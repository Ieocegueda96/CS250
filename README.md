How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding user needs is essential to creating the best product to meet those needs. Communication is the key to obtain this understanding.
Interviews are a great way of understanding the user needs. Product owners create "user stories" from these interviews with different business level users.
"User stories" serve to break down requirementes into small, easy to understand pieces. It is formed with three parts: the actor, what the actor needs, and why they need it.
These stories are then put into a backlog where the most important features are worked on first.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs has been more defined thanks to this course. From what I have learned about the agile process, I know that first I need a good understanding
of what the program solves and how it can solve it. With this knowledge, I can start to work on the important features first. While working on the product, scrum sprints are
a great way of breaking down developement into small chunks where progress can be noted and any feedback and changes can be made. After each sprint, I will do a retrospective into
what worked and what I could improve on. I will also use this time to plan out the next sprint. From this point, I will repeat until the program is finished and implimented.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good member of a software development team, as in any other team, means putting in the effort and pulling your weight. With software development, communication is very
important in order to keep the project on track and to work out any difficulties that might occur along the way. This type of communication involves participation in the daily
stand up meetings and throughout the day with other members of the team including the product owner and testers.
